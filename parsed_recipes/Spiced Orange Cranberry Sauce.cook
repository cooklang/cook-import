Bring the @orange juice{0.75%cup} (3/4 cup), @brown sugar{0.5%cup} (1/2 cup packed), pinch of @salt{0%pinch}, and @cinnamon{0.25%tsp} (1/4 teaspoon) to a boil in a medium pot.
Add the @cranberries{8.0%oz} (and 1 tablespoon @orange zest{1.0%tbsp}, if using), turn heat to medium-low, and simmer uncovered for ~{10%minutes}, or until most of the cranberries have burst and the sauce has thickened. If some cranberries don't burst, you can use a potato masher or the back of a wooden spoon on the side of the pot to help them along.
Allow sauce to completely cool (at least ~{20%minutes}) before serving. Garnish with more orange zest if desired.
